# dating_app

This dating app was made to match users together based on their city, sexual orientation, gender, and numerology. Users can choose to match or not match and if there is a mutual match, users can begin a chat session with each other.

The way the numerology works is by adding up all the digits of their birthday until they get a single number between 1 and 9. More information regarding each number, what they mean, and how they pair with other numbers can be found [here](http://astrology-numerology.com/num-relationship.html).
